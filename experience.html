    </div>
    <div class="content">
        <p>As a photographer and videographer, I have experience in portrait, event, product, and real estate 
            photography, as well as commercial and documentary videography. I also have knowledge of drone 
            videography and creating content for corporate, music video, and wedding projects. My skills 
            include working with both natural and studio lighting, but my passion is Cityscapes & the Concrete Jungle.
            <br><br>
            Iâ€™m proficient in a range of equipment, including DSLR and mirrorless cameras (Canon EOS 5D 
            Mark IV, Sony A7S III), as well as cinema cameras like the Blackmagic URSA Mini Pro. I use 
            software such as Adobe Photoshop, Lightroom, Premiere Pro, and DaVinci Resolve for editing, 
            color grading, and video production. My workflow includes sound editing with Adobe 
            and motion graphics with After Effects to complete my projects.</p>
